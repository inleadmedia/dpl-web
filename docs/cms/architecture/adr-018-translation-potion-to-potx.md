# Architecture Decision Record: Translation: Moving from Potion to POTX

## Context

[ADR-009](./adr-009-translation-system.md) chose
[Potion](https://www.drupal.org/project/potion) to scan the codebase for
translatable strings. Potion is unmaintained. We pinned it to a `dev-2.x` git
commit and carried seven patches to keep it working, two of them purely for
Drupal 10 compatibility. It is not Drupal 11 ready: its annotation extractor is
built on the doctrine annotation machinery that Drupal 11 removes.

ADR-009 rejected [POTX](https://www.drupal.org/project/potx) because it
"extract[s] strings to a `.pot` file without having the possibility of filling
in the existing translations". This was a misunderstanding of what the module
offered - potx fills in the translations held in the database as it scans.

## Decision

We use POTX instead of Potion for scanning.

Scanning is done by our own `dpl_po:scan-source` Drush command, which drives
the potx API directly. It replaces both `potion:generate` and `potion:fill`:
the codebase is scanned and the translations we already have are filled in, in
a single pass.

Potx ships a `drush potx` command of its own. It writes template files of its
own shape, in a place of its own choosing, and getting from those to the single
file we hand to POEditor means doing the same work anyway. So we call the API
rather than the command.

### What gets scanned

Our own code is covered by directory - `modules/custom`, `themes/custom` and
the profile. Some of our modules only run on some sites, `bnf_client` and
`bnf_server` on the BNF site and `dpl_webmaster` on webmaster sites, and their
strings need translating whether or not the site running the scan has them
turned on.

Contrib is covered by the list in
[`scanned_modules.txt`](../../../cms/web/modules/custom/dpl_po/scanned_modules.txt),
which the command reads. Core is left out either way; its translations come
from localize.drupal.org.

That list is worth understanding before changing it. It is not a considered
selection of the contrib projects worth translating: it was added in 33cc8d770
because Potion crashed on some modules, and naming what to include was the safe
way to stop a newly added module breaking the workflow without it being obvious
why. Potx does not crash, so the reason is gone - but the list has quietly been
deciding what reaches POEditor ever since. Dropping it takes the file from
around 6,000 terms to around 13,400, most of them contrib strings that
localize.drupal.org already translates. That is a decision about what we ask
translators to work on, so it is left for its own day.

The POEditor integration is unchanged - same file, same path, same webhook.

### Patches

Potx has a handful of bugs that cost us strings or produce a file gettext
cannot read. Where the bug is potx', we patch potx rather than working around
it in our own command, so that the fix disappears when it lands upstream.

The patches live in [`cms/patches/`](../../../cms/patches/) and are listed in
`composer.json`. Each one carries a header explaining what it changes, why we
need it, and whether it is filed upstream - that is where to look, rather than
here, so the two cannot drift apart.

Where the problem is instead about the shape of the file we produce, the
command deals with it. A file gettext cannot read still stops the workflow: the
next step merges the scan output with the configuration translations using
`msgcat`, which names the offending file and line and writes nothing.

### Why the 2.x alpha and not the 1.x stable release

`8.x-1.1` declares Drupal 11 compatibility, but the branch does not deliver it.
The 2.x branch contains every commit in `8.x-1.1` plus the fixes we depend on:

- [#3308598](https://www.drupal.org/project/potx/issues/3308598): Drush 10+
  support in 1.x was inadequate. We drive potx entirely from Drush.
- [#3528177](https://www.drupal.org/project/potx/issues/3528177): Twig scanning
  stopped recognising `t` filters as of Twig 3.21, which is the Twig Drupal 11
  ships.
- [#3570518](https://www.drupal.org/project/potx/issues/3570518): core language
  list parsing is not Drupal 11 compatible.
- [#3354887](https://www.drupal.org/project/potx/issues/3354887): the 1.x info
  file claimed core compatibility it did not have.

2.x additionally carries the Drupal 12 compatibility work.

## Consequences

- Seven patches and a git-commit pin become a handful of patches on a tagged
  release supporting Drupal 10, 11 and 12.
- Potx covers more than Potion did: `.theme` files, JavaScript,
  `*.permissions.yml` and config schema labels. Roughly a thousand strings
  became translatable that never were, including the Novel theme settings form.
- Potx skips `tests/`, `vendor/` and `*.api.php`. About 140 strings left the
  translation file - PHPUnit assertion messages and test fixtures that should
  never have reached translators.
- Potx also extracts logger calls, so log messages now appear in POEditor. We
  accepted that rather than patching it out.
- Potion silently trimmed whitespace from every string. A few msgids therefore
  change shape - and `' DKK'` becomes translatable at all, which it was not
  before.
- Measured in a CI-equivalent environment, against the previous file: 6,742 of
  6,926 terms unchanged, 1,045 added, 184 dropped. No surviving term lost its
  translation. Of the dropped terms, 170 carried a Danish translation, but 133
  of those exist only in `tests/` directories or `*.api.php` files - the
  translators had been translating test fixtures.

## Alternatives considered

1. Keeping Potion and maintaining it ourselves. It offers nothing that potx
   does not, so this would be work spent on staying where we are.
2. Patching potx to keep scanning `tests/`, so the generated file stays
   identical to the Potion one. Rejected - it would mean translating PHPUnit
   assertion messages forever.
3. [ITK's translation extractor](https://github.com/itk-dev/drupal_translation_extractor),
   which extracts from PHP, Twig and JavaScript using Symfony's translation
   component. We found no advantage over potx, and it is published on GitHub by
   a single vendor where potx is a drupal.org project with an established
   maintainer team.
