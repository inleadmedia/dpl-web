/**
 * Our custom logic for creating eventinstances, as part of updating series.
 *
 * This logic is run whenever the recurrence of an eventseries is updated. Note
 * that newly created series never reach a creator plugin - recurring_events
 * creates the instances of those itself.
 *
 * The default plugin deletes every instance of the series and creates them all
 * again from the new recurrence. We cannot afford that: the ID of an
 * eventinstance is its URL and its ID in /api/v1/events, and an instance can
 * carry data that exists nowhere else - an editor may have given a single
 * occurrence its own title, image or ticket categories. So we only delete the
 * occurrences that the new recurrence no longer contains, and only create the
 * ones that are not there yet.
 *
 * @todo Nothing about that problem is specific to these sites, so the
 *   reconciliation belongs upstream, as a creator plugin recurring_events
 *   ships itself. Reading and writing the dates through our own bundle class
 *   is what keeps this plugin from being contributed as it stands.
 *
