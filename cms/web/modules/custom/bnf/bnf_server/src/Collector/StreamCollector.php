/**
 * Publishes the names of the content streams libraries can subscribe to.
 *
 * A stream is a taxonomy term here on the BNF site, and library sites report
 * their subscriptions by its UUID - the only identifier that means the same
 * thing on all of them. That makes the subscription metric join-able but
 * unreadable, so this collector supplies the missing half: the authoritative
 * name, published by the one site that owns it.
 *
 * The two are meant to be joined at query time, which keeps the name in one
 * place and current. A dashboard counting subscribers per stream reads:
 *
 * @code
 * count by (stream) (dpl_cms_bnf_subscription_info)
 *   * on (stream) group_left(name) dpl_cms_bnf_stream_info
 * @endcode
 *
 * Doing it this way rather than having each library ask us for the name is
 * deliberate. A lookup at scrape time would put 100+ sites on our door every
 * scrape interval, and would add a network call to the one code path that
 * must never be slow. Prometheus already collects from both ends; letting it
 * do the join costs nothing.
 *
 * Series count is the number of terms in the vocabularies below, on this one
 * site - libraries do not multiply it. Categories are curated, but editors
 * create tags freely as they write, so this grows with the taxonomy. Should
 * that get out of hand, the fix is to publish only terms some content is
 * actually filed under; a term nobody can reach a listing page for is not a
 * stream anyone can subscribe to.
 *
 * @see \Drupal\bnf_client\Collector\SubscriptionCollector
